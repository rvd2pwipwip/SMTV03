# TV App Project

## Project Context
This is a modern TV application built with React and Vite, focusing on providing an exceptional user experience through careful UX design and implementation. The app is designed specifically for TV displays with a fixed 1920x1080 viewport.

## Tech Stack
- React (Latest version)
- Vite (Build tool)
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript/TypeScript (gradual adoption)

## Project Goals
- Create a TV-optimized application
- Implement TV-specific UX patterns
- Learn and apply React-Vite development
- Build a maintainable and scalable codebase

## Development Guidelines
1. **Code Organization**
   - Follow component-based architecture
   - Maintain clear separation of concerns
   - Use modern React patterns and hooks

2. **TV-Specific Styling**
   - Fixed 1920x1080 viewport
   - Focus-driven navigation
   - Remote control optimization
   - No responsive design needed

3. **UX Principles**
   - Optimize for 10ft viewing distance
   - Focus on remote control navigation
   - Ensure clear focus states
   - Implement smooth transitions
   - Maintain safe area margins (48px)
