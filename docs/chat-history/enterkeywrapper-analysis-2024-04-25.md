# EnterKeyWrapper Analysis - April 25, 2024

## Current Implementation Analysis

1. **Tight Coupling with ChannelCard**
   - Directly renders `ChannelCard` inside
   - Only handles Enter key events
   - Specifically designed for channel selection

2. **Focus Management**
   - Works through Norigin's spatial navigation system
   - Focus ring display on ChannelCard
   - Proper focus restoration

3. **Current Issues**
   - Breaking focus ring display
   - Enter key event handling problems

## Plan for Generic Implementation

1. **Component Structure Changes**
   - Make it a true wrapper component that accepts any children
   - Remove direct `ChannelCard` dependency
   - Keep the focus management intact

2. **Focus Management Preservation**
   - Maintain focus ring display by:
     - Properly forwarding refs
     - Preserving focus context
     - Ensuring focus events bubble correctly

3. **Event Handling Improvements**
   - Support multiple keyboard events (not just Enter)
   - Allow custom event handlers
   - Maintain event propagation

4. **Props Interface**
   - Add support for:
     - Custom keyboard event handlers
     - Focus management props
     - Accessibility attributes
     - Custom styling

5. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Use React's `forwardRef` for proper ref handling
   - Implement proper event delegation
   - Maintain focus context through the component tree

6. **Testing Considerations**
   - Test focus ring display
   - Verify keyboard event handling
   - Check focus restoration
   - Validate accessibility

7. **Migration Path**
   - Create new generic wrapper
   - Test with existing ChannelCard
   - Gradually migrate other components
   - Maintain backward compatibility

## Key Success Factors
- Proper ref forwarding
- Maintaining focus context
- Careful event handling
- Preserving existing functionality
